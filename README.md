#Gravity Car

Made by Andreu Rojas and Carlos Cabreira

Reach the end of the circuit without falling off! You can see your velocity, time, and best record on the window title.

Use the directional arrows to control the vehicle and G to invert the gravity. 
You can only invert the gravity if you are in contact with the floor or the roof!
Be careful with the red sliders: they will move with gravity as you does. 
The end of the circuit is signed with two green pillars.

~Enjoy!
